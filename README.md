# Kao The Kangaroo 2 PAK Tools
This python script extract the .PAK file find in the steam version of Kao The Kangaroo 2.<br>
Tested on Python 3.7 on Windows 10, should work on other system as well.<br>
<br>
Usage: <pre>python unpack.py {file path}</code></pre>
<br>
The rough structure of pak file is in Pak_Structure.txt, I figure it out myslef because I have nothing else to do.<br>
I might write another script to repack the file in the future.<br>
<br>
Any feedback is appreciated.
